# Pre-module Assignment

This is Tejas Jyothi's pre-module assignment. I have read in a dataset and my script outputs the species with greatest average petal length.
My python script is in petal.py with an additional test.py for unit tests. The requirements.txt file remains the same as what was provided.


## Running The Program

Simply enter
```
   python petal.py
   ```
in the command line and the program should run.
